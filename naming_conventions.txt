#TODO move this to a "documentation place"

* Offset variables are always called <something>_offset
* Size variables are always called <something>_len
  * __len__ overloads always to the logical size
  *
* the attributes module define the attributes contents. By definition,
you can only have the contents if the attribute is resident, otherwise, default
the content to the data run. This puts pressure in the entry class to correct stuff,
for example, the size of the data attribute, which can always be derived, even without
the data
